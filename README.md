Software Design Principles
Software design principles are guidelines that help developers and designers create software that is maintainable, scalable, and robust. These principles ensure that the software is well-structured and easy to understand, modify, and extend.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
 Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):
Avoid duplication of code by abstracting common functionality.

Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS):
Keep designs and implementations simple and straightforward.

You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):
Do not add functionality until it is necessary.
Importance: Prevents over-engineering and keeps the codebase manageable.

Separation of Concerns (SoC):
Separate a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern.
Importance: Improves modularity and enhances maintainability.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, self-contained units called modules. Each module is responsible for a specific part of the system's functionality and can be developed, tested, and maintained independently of the other modules.

Improves Maintainability:

Isolation: Issues in one module can be isolated and fixed without affecting other parts of the system.
Readability: Smaller, well-defined modules are easier to understand and modify.
Reusability: Modules can be reused across different parts of the application or in different projects, reducing redundancy.
Enhances Scalability:

Independent Development: Modules can be developed and scaled independently, allowing for parallel development and efficient allocation of resources.
Performance Optimization: Performance bottlenecks can be identified and optimized within individual modules without affecting the entire system.
Modular Growth: New features can be added by creating new modules or extending existing ones without significant changes to the overall system.
Testing in Software Engineering
Testing in software engineering is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets specified requirements and functions correctly. The main goals of testing are to identify and fix bugs, ensure quality, and verify that the software performs as intended under various conditions.
